// Calculates if pizza can be equally distributed among partygoers. If it's fair, it will say so. If not, it will tell you how many more slices are needed to make everyone able to get the same amount of pizza!

// Change these variables if you'd like!

// This calculates stuff. Don't change anything below!

let leftOverSlices = numberOfSlices % numberOfPeople;                              // How many slices are not given out after everyone gets an equal amount in an unfair situation
